## Project Description
In an ambitious endeavor to advance the field of medical diagnostics, this project sets out to harness the power of deep learning for the critical task of distinguishing between normal and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. At the heart of this initiative is a robust dataset amalgamated from two of the most esteemed collections in the realm of heartbeat classification: the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. This compilation offers an extensive array of heartbeat signals, meticulously preprocessed and segmented to represent individual heartbeats, thus providing a fertile ground for training a sophisticated neural network.

The chosen dataset is not only substantial in volume but also in variety, encompassing a wide spectrum of cardiac abnormalities, including various arrhythmias and instances of myocardial infarction, alongside normal cardiac activity. This diversity is instrumental in developing a model with a nuanced understanding of cardiac rhythms, capable of identifying subtle deviations indicative of underlying heart conditions. The signals, having been derived from high-fidelity sources, maintain a high resolution of cardiac activity, which is pivotal for capturing the intricate details necessary for accurate classification.

The project's methodology involves leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, possibly exploring the realms of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), given their proven efficacy in handling time-series data like ECG signals. A significant aspect of this exploration will be to experiment with various architectural tweaks and parameter optimizations to hone the model's ability to discern the nuanced differences between normal and pathological heartbeats.
